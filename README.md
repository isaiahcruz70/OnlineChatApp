This project was a test if I still knew some php as well as grow on my knowledge in php. 
Chat Application using PHP with MySQL & JavaScript: 
In this project we create a Complete Chat Application using PHP with MySQL & JavaScript. 
In this chat app, first you've to signup if you're new on the chat application then after successfully signed up, you'll be redirected to the users area page where users like you who have signed to this chat app will appear there with their full name, profile image, active status and so on. 
You can select any user to start to chat with them. You can also easily log out from the chat application by clicking on the logout button and after successful logout, you'll be redirected to the login page of the chat app and your status will be offline for other signed-up users. 
You've to log in with your signed-up email and password to enter the chatting page again.

If you would like to test the project for your self I will provide a step by step guide to do so. Links will be provided at the end.

Step 1: We download the project and import it to your IDE of your choice.

Step 2: Now download XAMMP. We use XAMMP to allow us to host the project locally as well as to be able to connect our project to the database (phpmyadmin).

Step 3: After installing XAMMP move the project to XAMMP(folder) > htdocs.

Step 4: Now run the XAMMP application and install Apache and Mysql.

Step 5: After installing both now click the start button for both.

Step 6: Now got to http://localhost/phpmyadmin and import the chatapp.sql to phpmyadmin.
(Tip) Importing chatapp.sql will add all required tables for the project to run properly.

Step 7: After importing the tables needed you can now go to http://localhost/onlinechatapp/login.php
Your done now you can explore the chat app by creating an account and chat with yourself.
